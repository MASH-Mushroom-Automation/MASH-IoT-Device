# M.A.S.H. Stakeholder Interviews

## Interview Methodology
The project team conducted in-depth interviews with key stakeholders in the Philippine mushroom farming industry to validate the problem statement, assess the feasibility of the proposed solution, and gather insights for system design. Interviews were conducted between August 9-20, 2025, with follow-up consultations as needed.

## Interview 1: Mr. Cristobal R. Carcelia Jr. (Small-Scale Grower)

**Date:** August 9 & 12, 2025
**Location:** Caloocan City
**Perspective:** Urban, Small-Scale Cultivator
**Background:** Experienced oyster mushroom grower operating a small-scale urban farm

### Key Findings

#### Environmental Control Challenges
- **Critical Factor**: Maintaining a cool, dark, and humid environment is paramount for successful cultivation
- **Climate Impact**: The hot Philippine climate, especially during summer, is a significant obstacle to consistent production
- **Current Methods**: Relies on manual environmental management with limited monitoring tools

#### Contamination and Pest Issues
- **Primary Problem**: Insect infestation identified as the single biggest challenge
- **Contamination Sources**: Can originate from low-quality fruiting bags, requiring immediate removal to prevent widespread loss
- **Economic Impact**: Significant crop losses affect income stability

#### Fruiting Bag Quality Issues
- **Success Dependency**: Harvest success is highly dependent on the quality of purchased fruiting bags
- **Risk Factor**: Quality is described as "luck-based" (swertihan), introducing uncertainty into the cultivation process

### Support for M.A.S.H. Solution

#### Technology Acceptance
- **Enthusiasm Level**: High receptiveness to technology integration
- **Mobile App Response**: "Ay, of course. Yeah. Yeah." when presented with real-time monitoring concept
- **Value Recognition**: Immediate understanding of the benefits of real-time sensor data

#### Investment Willingness
- **Cost Acceptance**: Views the estimated prototype cost as reasonable for small-scale operations
- **Economic Justification**: Recognizes the potential for improved productivity and income

#### E-commerce Validation
- **Market Gap**: Detailed the significant price disparity between low "gate prices" paid to wholesalers and higher retail prices
- **Direct Sales Advantage**: Affirmed that selling directly to consumers is the "best" way to maximize income
- **Middleman Elimination**: Supports the e-commerce platform's goal of bypassing intermediaries

## Interview 2: Mr. Ramel (Fruiting Bag Producer and Mushroom Grower)

**Date:** August 10, 2025
**Perspective:** Commercial Producer
**Background:** Business focused on producing and selling fruiting bags, with active mushroom cultivation experience

### Key Findings

#### Production Challenges
- **Contamination Source**: Primary production hurdle originates from initial spawn (binhi), insufficient pasteurization, or pest infiltration
- **Quality Control**: Emphasizes the importance of proper sterilization and contamination prevention

#### Environmental Monitoring
- **Current Practice**: Gauges environmental conditions based on physical sensation ("pakiramdam ko")
- **Inconsistency Issues**: Subjective monitoring methods prone to human error and inconsistency

#### Seasonal Challenges
- **Weather Dependency**: Summer months present the most significant challenges
- **Manual Intervention**: Requires manual intervention to prevent fruiting bags from drying out during hot periods

### Support for M.A.S.H. Solution

#### Technical Validation
- **Design Approval**: Upon reviewing the automated growing chamber design, affirmed technical correctness ("Okay yung lahat ng ano, sakto lahat dun... tama naman yung ginagawa niya")
- **Component Integration**: Validated the logical integration of system components

#### Lifespan Extension Benefits
- **Drying Prevention**: Agreed that the primary reason bags stop producing is drying out
- **Humidifier Validation**: Confirmed that the system's humidifier would directly address this issue and prolong harvest cycles

#### Market Opportunity
- **Business Model**: Current operations involve selling fruiting bags to aspiring growers
- **Add-on Potential**: Recognizes M.A.S.H. system as a valuable add-on product for customers

## Interview 3: Ms. Hazel (BPI Mushroom Expert)

**Date:** August 20, 2025
**Location:** Bureau of Plant Industry, Manila
**Perspective:** Scientific and Industry Expert
**Background:** Mushroom specialist providing technical guidance and industry oversight

### Key Strategic Recommendations

#### Scope Refinement
- **Scope Limitation**: Advised focusing exclusively on post-harvesting stage and single variety (white oyster mushroom)
- **Timeline Consideration**: Narrow scope essential for completion within thesis timeframe

#### Target Market Focus
- **User Segment**: System best suited for established medium-to-large scale growers
- **Investment Capacity**: Target users must have resources to invest in and maintain advanced technology

#### Project Framing
- **Academic Tone**: Recommended using formal academic language ("Development of...")
- **Structure**: Rationale should first present problems, then solutions
- **Clarity**: Emphasized clear problem-solution framework

### Actionable Guidance

#### Performance Targets
- **Yield Goal**: Aim for specific, measurable target (e.g., 20% increase from typical 800 grams per bag)
- **Technical Standards**: IoT sensors must be calibrated to precise scientific standards for white oyster mushrooms
  - Temperature: 25-28°C
  - Humidity: 80-90%
  - CO2: 10k-15k ppm

#### Validation Requirements
- **Field Research**: Stressed importance of visiting at least two farms for real-world data collection
- **Practical Validation**: Ensure project is realistic, not just theoretical
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Recommended partnering with Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) for business case verification and ROI analysis

## Interview Analysis and Synthesis

### Problem Validation
All interviews confirmed the core challenges identified in the literature review:
- **Environmental Control**: Critical factor validated by all stakeholders
- **Contamination**: Primary concern across production and cultivation stages
- **Economic Pressures**: Price disparities and middleman dependency confirmed
- **Technology Gap**: Current reliance on manual, subjective methods

### Solution Feasibility
- **Technical Acceptance**: High enthusiasm for IoT and mobile monitoring solutions
- **Economic Viability**: Willingness to invest indicates market readiness
- **Practical Implementation**: Expert validation of technical approach and component selection

### Design Implications
- **User-Centered Design**: Mobile app interface validated as key user interaction point
- **Offline Capability**: Critical for areas with intermittent connectivity
- **Scalability**: Modular design should accommodate different farm sizes
- **Economic Model**: Direct-to-consumer sales model strongly supported

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technology Adoption**: Start with tech-savvy growers for initial implementation
- **Support Systems**: Develop comprehensive training and support programs
- **Cost Barriers**: Consider phased implementation or financing options
- **Infrastructure**: Design for variable connectivity and power conditions

## Recommendations for Project Development

### Immediate Actions
1. **Prototype Refinement**: Incorporate specific environmental ranges validated by BPI expert
2. **User Testing**: Conduct additional grower interviews for UI/UX validation
3. **Field Trials**: Plan visits to 2-3 farms for real-world testing and data collection

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Scalability Planning**: Design system for easy expansion to multiple chambers
2. **Support Infrastructure**: Develop maintenance and training programs
3. **Market Development**: Build partnerships with agricultural cooperatives
4. **Policy Engagement**: Collaborate with DA and DTI for broader adoption

These stakeholder interviews provide critical validation for the M.A.S.H. system's relevance, feasibility, and potential impact on Philippine mushroom farming practices.
