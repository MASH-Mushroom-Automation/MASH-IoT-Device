## Citation Methodology

This bibliography follows APA 7th edition formatting standards. References are organized by topic area for clarity and include both peer-reviewed academic publications and institutional sources. All cited works were accessed and reviewed between August 2024 and September 2025.

## Research Gaps Identified

While the literature provides strong validation for IoT applications in mushroom cultivation, several gaps remain:
- Limited studies on integrated IoT-AI-e-commerce systems specifically for Philippine conditions
- Need for localized environmental parameter optimization for tropical climates
- Limited research on small-scale grower technology adoption barriers in developing countries
- Gap in studies examining the complete value chain from cultivation to direct consumer sales

The M.A.S.H. project addresses these gaps by providing a comprehensive, context-specific solution validated through stakeholder interviews and technical feasibility studies.
